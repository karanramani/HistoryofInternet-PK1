<h1 style="text-align: center;">People</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">YouTube, Digg and Facebook</h3>
    <p>The tail of the world wide web. The new and fancy route of Communication, controlled by no one but shaped by everyone.</p>
    <p> YouTube, a site that was bought over by Google company, for $1.65 billion dollars. The site that is famous worldwide holding so many videos. The Co-Founder, Chad Hurley thinks that Internet is all about connecting the individual. On the other hand there is a CEO of Digg. Mr. Jay Adelson thinks that connecting with peers is more better.</p>
    <img style="width: 50%; float: left; padding:20px;" src="images/youtube.jpg" alt="youtube">
    <p> For an average person, before YouTube it was hard to get on screen, they would need a whole crew. YouTube has given power to everyone to broadcast them selves by using smaller cameras and uploading the video to the Internet.</p>
    <p> On the other hand Digg at the time was also developing something similar. Helping the community to decide what is important and host the blog like news, and then there was Facebook.</p>
    <p> Mark Zuckerberg, the guy who understood deeply of how much time people spend communicating. While Facebook was doing anything and everything to provide what people needed there were people</p> <img style="width: 50%; float: right; padding:20px;" src="images/fb.jpg" alt="Facebook-Logo"><p> like David Weekley, Justin Frankel, Cabel Sasser and Steve Frank who thought music needs to be revolutionized.</p>
    <p> Instead of going over to the store to get cd’s they thought of putting music through the Internet. MP3 provided a way to compress the data of music so it became easier to store and transfer the music. That was just a start.</p>
    <p> But bringing music into the internet was not keeping record labels happy. It enabled people to be able to download music and use it over for their YouTube video purposes even if they had no rights to the music.</p>
    <p> A college student Fanning created a software that allowed users to find if a connected user has the music that they like. </p><img style="width: 30%; float: left; padding:20px;" src="images/mp3.jpg" alt="MP# Cassette"><p>If yes, they are able to download the music straight to their computer. Within four moths this app called Napster had passed a million download mark. Making Napster the fastest spreading software yet. The software created concerns fo an intellectual property safety.</p>
    <p> After the whole Napster and their music lawsuits, Steve Jobs came in with apple’s iTunes music store where songs were sold for 99 cents a piece with strict copyrights which made record label companies and music creators really happy.</p>
    <p> Amidst all of that then came time of Web 2.0. After the dot com crisis web 2.0 was ready and loaded with social media apps, dating apps, apps like myspace.com which was found in 2003. By two LA residents. During the web 2.0 time Facebook as well upgraded their services by mapping out all of human ways of interactions. On top of that Facebook developed a whole new way of online marketing.</p>
    <p> All over the world at the time, everyone is able to write and post blogs, spread the word, spread the news. Each day we still see the web growing and providing more and more to the people. We might see a whole new level in the next five years.</p>
