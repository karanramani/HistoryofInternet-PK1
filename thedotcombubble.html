<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Dot Com Bubble</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">amazon.com and eBay.com</h3>

  <p>
      Industrial revolution, amazon and eBay has created a whole new level of shopping online, using credit-cards, spending money online to buy goods at click of a mouse button.
      Birthplace of amazon.com is a garage of a house in Suburban Seattle belonged to Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com. The founder started with selling books online, launched amazon in summer of 1995.
  </p>

  <p>
      On the other hand Pierre Omidyar the founder of eBay was another visionary who thought the online web presence and selling goods using the internet is the future.
      While Jeff Bezos was all about the business plan, with market research. When Pierre was a coder more of a developer without a market plan.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    At the start of the eBay very useless items were listed but one site that had functionalities to buy/sell or bid over items. That actually stood out to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
      On the other side Amazon was selling custom desks, books and similar other items.
  </p>

  <p>
      Suddenly both companies started getting more and more visitors so quickly that the founders did not go unnoticed. They started getting more and more revenue and founders got recognized by the wall street in no time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Internet needed just four years before it had 50 million users. Collision of two technologies, silicon chip, introduced by Intel. Internet era started from 1995. In 1997 Jeff Bezos came in with the business plan and amazon.com domain.
    Any time when Jeff had the opportunity, he would come in and lower the prizes of the goods. Strategic plan of Jeff was profits doesn’t matter in order to get big fast. But one valuable data managing was the credit cards.
    To understand the data that was amazon using from the customer was a delicate and privacy matter, the credit card number and to understand how amazon dealt with that, is where the encryptions comes in.
  </p>

  <p>
      Powerful methods of encrypting mathematically, a method that was developed during world war 2. Although it needed an upgrade. In the context of online comers Public key cryptography was created.
      The encryption began from using the codes and encryptions created and generated by the receiver. Public key and Private key are the combinations that needed to be used.
  </p>

  <p>
      Ebay at the beginning was a company ignored by the wall street, at the time company hired a Marketing person a person who would have the business plan.
      Along with that alot of other business students started heading to silicon valley. To get their hands in for the .com boom!
  </p>

  <p>
      Internet also started the era of day trader. Made the stock market look like casino. During the 90s almost everyday an ecommerce company gets registered.
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>
      Next to internet era was a telecommunication. Companies were ready to layout miles of fiber optic cables providing high speed frequency of internet.
      Fiber optic cable transmits 10 billions of pulses of digital information every second.
  </p>

  <p>
      The bubble finally crashed in 2000 and 2001, started loosing the stock market interest and caused panic. To keep up with the bubble people had created hedges and made investors go after things that actually did not hold much value.
      But despite of others companies like Amazon and eBay still stood strong with their business plans. Providing the online consumers with the goods with better customer services, listening to complaints,
      getting functionalities such as creating customer reviews so the company can focus on creating customer relation when book or goods makers can focus on creating their product, same goes for eBay and their customer database,
      doing and following such market plans kept them up and running, even today.
  </p>

  <p> Based on their success, and other companies running out of business, it actually created more entrepreneurs, the people who had been burnt yet learnt from their experiences.
      Web is slowly becoming a foundation of our economy as of now, and we don’t even realize how fast we are moving along with the web.
